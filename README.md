# List of Computer Science and Engineering Journals with FREE Article Processing Charge (APC) for Authors


# Introduction

This is a [list of journals](https://github.com/xeroxism/free-apc-computer-science-journals/blob/main/journals/free-apc-computer-science-journals.md) that *do not charge authors any fee* for publishing research articles in computer science and computer engineering.

It was necessitated by the number of requests or research networks by new authors (researchers) that are looking forward to make their first peer-review article.

And I hope it would be useful to such persons. And Most importantly, it is being hosted here in Github for the purpose of collaborative updating and maintenance.

So [contributions](https://github.com/xeroxism/free-apc-computer-science-journals/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcomed!

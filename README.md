# List of Computer Science and Engineering Journals with FREE Article Processing Charge (APC) for Authors

# Introduction

This is a list of journals that do not charge authors any fee for publishing research articles in computer science and computer engineering.

It was necessitated by the number of requests or research networks by new authors (researchers) that are looking forward to make their first peer-review article.

And I hope it would be useful to such persons. And Most importantly, it is being hosted here in Github for the purpose of collaborative updating and maintenance.

So contributions are welcomed!

## Guidelines

- Make sure the journal APC is ***FREE***. Double-check if needed.

- Ensure that the journal is indexed in any popular indexing database engines like, [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ), [SCOPUS](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus/how-scopus-works/content/content-policy-and-selection), [Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html), etc.

- Insert your links in alphabetical order. If you see a misplaced link, please reorder it and submit a PR.

- Provide secure links. Always prefer a ```https``` link over a ```http``` one -- as long as they are on the same domain and serve the same content.

- No URL shortener links will be accepted.

### Formatting

- All lists are .md files. Try to learn [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax. It's simple!



Examples

- There should be no line between two links.

	[International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): English)

  

	[Another International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): French)

 

-  In journals published in multiple languages, the languages should be separated with commas:
	
	```

	[Another International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): English, Russian, ...)

	```

- Put a single space between the link and its ISSN:
	
	```

	BAD: [International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html)  (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): English)

	GOOD: [International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): English

	```

- The ISSN comes before language(s):
	
	```

	BAD: [International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (LANGUAGE(S): English, ISSN: 12345-03)

	GOOD: [International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): English)

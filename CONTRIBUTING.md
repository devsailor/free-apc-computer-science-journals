## Contribution Code of Conduct

By contributing to you agree to respect the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/xeroxism/free-apc-computer-science-journals/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of this repository.

## Contribution is simple:

Simply insert the FULL NAME that is linked to the Homepage of the journal, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), and the language(s) of publishing. Follow the guidelines below.

## Guidelines

- Make sure the journal APC is ***FREE***. Double-check if needed.

- Ensure that the journal is indexed in any popular indexing database engines like, [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) (DOAJ), [SCOPUS](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus/how-scopus-works/content/content-policy-and-selection), [Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html), etc.

- Insert your links in alphabetical order. If you see a misplaced link, please reorder it and submit a PR.

- Provide secure links. Always prefer a ```https``` link over a ```http``` one -- as long as they are on the same domain and serve the same content.

- No URL shortener links will be accepted.

### Formatting

- All lists are .md files. Try to learn [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax. It's simple!



Examples

- There should be no line between two links.

	[International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): English)
	[Another International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): French)

 

-  In journals published in multiple languages, the languages should be separated with commas:
	
	```

	[Another International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): English, Russian, ...)

	```

- Put a single space between the link and its ISSN:
	
	```

	BAD: [International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html)  (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): English)

	GOOD: [International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): English

	```

	```

	BAD: [International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (LANGUAGE(S): English, ISSN: 12345-03)

	GOOD: [International Journal of Example](https://journal.com/example.html) (ISSN: 12345-03, LANGUAGE(S): English)
